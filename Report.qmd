# Motivations and Initial Questions

# The Data

The data for this natural disaster analysis begins with two datasets from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS) and two datasets from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

## NOAA

Data from NOAA provides recordings of all storm events from 2020 and 2021. Data sets from each year provide significant information including the beginning and ending time and date of the disaster, the type of disaster, the location of the disaster, as well as injuries, deaths, and property damage as a result of the disaster. In each year, around 61,000 storm events occurred resulting in around 61,000 rows with 17 variables for each dataset. The raw data can be found [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp).

## FEMA

One of the datasets from FEMA is the Disaster Declarations Summary which provides information on all federally declared disasters beginning from the year 1953. The data lists the disaster declaration type of either a major disaster, fire management, or emergency declaration. Additionally, a more specific description of the incident is provided as variable `incidentType` as well as what recovery program was declared for the disaster. The other FEMA Disaster Summaries dataset proides information on financial assistance provided to the communities affected by select events. It includes the number of approved Individual Assistance requests, and individual, public assistance, and hazard mitigation grant amounts. The raw data can be found [here](https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/data-sets).

noaa2020 <- read.csv("NOAA2020.csv")
noaa2021 <- read.csv("NOAA2021.csv")
declarations <- read.csv("FEMAdeclaration.csv")
assistance <- read.csv("FEMAassistance.csv")
```

## Dates and Disaster Event

The first step in organizing the data to prepare for exploratory data analysis is filtering all the data sets to only include the disaster event of floods in the years 2020 and 2021. Both NOAA datasets are already filtered by year, so they were then filtered to contain rows where the variable `EVENT_TYPE` included the string `Flood`. Following this filter, the NOAA datasets in 2020 and 2021 include the injury, deaths, and property damage for flash floods, floods, coastal floods, and lakeshore floods. Additionally, the data from the FEMA Disaster Declarations Summary was filtered so that the variable `incidentType` only includes floods, severe storms, coastal storms, tropical storms, tsunamis, and typhoons that began in 2020 and 2021. Although all of these disasters are not explicitly floods, they were still included in analysis as they are disasters may have resulted in flooding in communities.

## Joining

The assistance data from FEMA includes aid provided to communities from select disasters. This data set does not provide the location or type of disaster but rather only includes the unique number assigned to each disaster by FEMA. The Disaster Declarations Summary from FEMA also includes the unique disaster number along with location and disaster type. These two data sets were combined using a `left_join` so that every row in the Disaster Declarations Summary data now includes the aid provided from the assistance data. 

## Damage to Property and Crops

The final step in cleaning the data for exploratory data analysis was converting `DAMAGE_PROPERTY` and `DAMAGE_CROPS` from the NOAA datasets to dollar values. The values for these variables were characters with a decimal and a "K" for thousands of dollars or "M" for millions of dollars. To convert to numerical dollar values, the characters "K" and "M" were extracted from each variable column and each column was then converted to a numeric value then multiplied by 1000 or 1000000 depending on whether the extracted character was a "K" or "M" respectively.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Summary of Floods

To begin the exploration of the most dangerous types of floods across the United States, I first looked at the most commonly occurring kinds of floods. For each year of 2020 and 2021, I created a line graph to visualize the number of flash floods, floods, coastal floods, and lakeshore floods over time and the results are in @fig-num.floods.2020 and @fig-num.floods.2021 below. To better understand the frequency of the different types of floods, I will define each kind. Flash floods are defined as floods that are caused by heavy rainfall over a short period of time (typically 6 hours or less). Floods are more long-term and often take place in dryer areas lasting days or weeks. Coastal floods occur when seawater submerges dry coastal land from rising tides. Lakeshore floods are similar to coastal floods but occur from smaller bodies of water submerging land.

```

In both 2020 and 2021, the most commonly occurring floods are flash floods and normal floods compared to coastal and lakeshore floods. During the beginning months of the year, there are more floods than coastal floods. However, by May in each year, the number of flash floods spikes quickly to occur more than 3 times more often than that of normal floods. The period of time in which flash floods occur more frequently than floods is between June and October in 2020 and between April and October in 2021. This coincides with the designated hurricane season in the United States which takes place between June and November. Hurricanes quickly bring strong winds and extremely heavy rainfall resulting in flash flooding.

A pattern can also be observed from normal flooding. In 2020 and 2021, the most floods occurred in May and March respectively. Both months are in the spring season which begins in March and ends in June. Following the winter season, temperatures begin to increase in spring resulting in melted snow which, in conjunction with spring rains, will result in flooding. 

## Summary of Deaths

I next look at the total deaths, summing both direct and indirect, for each flood type to determine if the most common type of floods are also the most dangerous. 

```{r, out.width = "200%"}
#| label: fig-num.deaths.2020
#| fig-cap: "Number of deaths from flash floods and floods each month in 2020"
#| echo: false
#| message: false


noaa2020$deaths <- noaa2020$DEATHS_DIRECT + noaa2020$DEATHS_INDIRECT
noaa2021$deaths <- noaa2021$DEATHS_DIRECT + noaa2021$DEATHS_INDIRECT

plot1 <- noaa2020 %>% filter(EVENT_TYPE == "Flood" | EVENT_TYPE == "Flash Flood") %>%
  group_by(MONTH_NAME, EVENT_TYPE) %>% 
  summarize(num_deaths = sum(deaths)) %>% 
  mutate(MONTH_NAME = factor(MONTH_NAME, levels = month.abb)) %>% 
  arrange(MONTH_NAME) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(MONTH_NAME, num_deaths, group = EVENT_TYPE, col = EVENT_TYPE)) + 
  geom_point() +

  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") + 
  labs(title = "Number of Deaths per Month in 2020") + 
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 11),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, 2))

```

```{r, out.width="200%"}
#| label: fig-num.deaths.2021
#| fig-cap: "Number of deaths from flash floods and floods each month in 2021"
#| echo: false
#| message: false

plot2 <- noaa2021 %>% filter(EVENT_TYPE == "Flood" | EVENT_TYPE == "Flash Flood") %>%
  group_by(MONTH_NAME, EVENT_TYPE) %>% 
  summarize(num_deaths = sum(deaths)) %>% 
  mutate(MONTH_NAME = factor(MONTH_NAME, levels = month.abb)) %>% 
  arrange(MONTH_NAME) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(MONTH_NAME, num_deaths, group = EVENT_TYPE, col = EVENT_TYPE)) +

        plot.title = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14))

plot2


```
In both years, zero direct deaths and indirect deaths were reported from coastal floods and lakeshore floods. This confirms the hypothesis that the more frequently occurring floods and flash floods result in more deaths and are therefore more dangerous. 

In 2020, @fig-num.floods.2020 shows that the most flash floods occurred in March. While there was a spike in the number of deaths in March, the most deaths from flash floods was in the month of March. Similarly, in 2021, @fig-num.floods.2021 depicts July having the most flash floods but the most deaths occurring in September with over 50 deaths.
