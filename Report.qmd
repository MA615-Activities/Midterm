# Motivations and Initial Questions

Floods are the most common natural disasters in the world. Floods can occur for a variety of reasons including sudden heavy rain from a hurricane or storm or simply when snow starts to quickly melt. Do all types of floods produce the same disastrous results or are some more common and more dangerous than others? Can a pattern be found in when certain floods occur throughout the year? Performing an exploratory data analysis on the most common natural disaster will allow us to answer these initial questions and develop more that relate to the perils of floods. 

# The Data

The data for this natural disaster analysis begins with two datasets from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS) and two datasets from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

## NOAA

Data from NOAA provides recordings of all storm events from 2020 and 2021. Data sets from each year provide significant information including the beginning and ending time and date of the disaster, the type of disaster, the location of the disaster, as well as injuries, deaths, and property damage as a result of the disaster. In each year, around 61,000 storm events occurred resulting in around 61,000 rows with 17 variables for each dataset. The raw data can be found [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp).

## FEMA

One of the datasets from FEMA is the Disaster Declarations Summary which provides information on all federally declared disasters beginning from the year 1953. The data lists the disaster declaration type of either a major disaster, fire management, or emergency declaration. Additionally, a more specific description of the incident is provided as variable `incidentType` as well as what recovery program was declared for the disaster. The other FEMA Disaster Summaries dataset provides information on financial assistance provided to the communities affected by select events. It includes the number of approved Individual Assistance requests, and individual, public assistance, and hazard mitigation grant amounts. The raw data can be found [here](https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/data-sets).

noaa2021 <- read.csv("NOAA2021.csv")
declarations <- read.csv("FEMAdeclaration.csv")
assistance <- read.csv("FEMAassistance.csv")
```

## Dates and Disaster Event

The first step in organizing the data to prepare for exploratory data analysis is filtering all the data sets to only include the disaster event of floods in the years 2020 and 2021. Both NOAA datasets are already filtered by year, so they were then filtered to contain rows where the variable `EVENT_TYPE` included the string `Flood`. Following this filter, the NOAA datasets in 2020 and 2021 include the injury, deaths, and property damage for flash floods, floods, coastal floods, and lakeshore floods. Additionally, the data from the FEMA Disaster Declarations Summary was filtered so that the variable `incidentType` only includes floods, severe storms, coastal storms, tropical storms, tsunamis, typhoons, and hurricanes that began in 2020 and 2021. Although all of these disasters are not explicitly floods, they were still included in analysis as they are disasters may have resulted in flooding in communities.

## Joining

The assistance data from FEMA includes aid provided to communities from select disasters. This data set does not provide the location or type of disaster but rather only includes the unique number assigned to each disaster by FEMA. The Disaster Declarations Summary from FEMA also includes the unique disaster number along with location and disaster type. These two data sets were combined using a `left_join` so that every row in the Disaster Declarations Summary data now includes the aid provided from the assistance data.

## Damage to Property and Crops

The final step in cleaning the data for exploratory data analysis was converting `DAMAGE_PROPERTY` and `DAMAGE_CROPS` from the NOAA datasets to dollar values. The values for these variables were characters with a decimal and a "K" for thousands of dollars or "M" for millions of dollars. To convert to numerical dollar values, the characters "K" and "M" were extracted from each variable column and each column was then converted to a numeric value then multiplied by 1000 or 1000000 depending on whether the extracted character was a "K" or "M" respectively.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Summary of Floods

To begin the exploration of the most dangerous types of floods across the United States, I first looked at the most commonly occurring kinds of floods. For each year of 2020 and 2021, I created a line graph to visualize the number of flash floods, floods, coastal floods, and lakeshore floods over time and the results are in @fig-num.floods.2020 and @fig-num.floods.2021 below. To better understand the frequency of the different types of floods, I will define each kind. Flash floods are defined as floods that are caused by heavy rainfall over a short period of time (typically 6 hours or less). Floods are more long-term and often take place in dryer areas lasting days or weeks. Coastal floods occur when seawater submerges dry coastal land from rising tides. Lakeshore floods are similar to coastal floods but occur from smaller bodies of water submerging land.

```

In both 2020 and 2021, the most commonly occurring floods are flash floods and normal floods compared to coastal and lakeshore floods. During the beginning months of the year, there are more floods than coastal floods. However, by May in each year, the number of flash floods spikes quickly to occur more than 3 times more often than that of normal floods. The period of time in which flash floods occur more frequently than floods is between June and October in 2020 and between April and October in 2021. This coincides with the designated hurricane season in the United States which takes place between June and November. Hurricanes quickly bring strong winds and extremely heavy rainfall resulting in flash flooding.

A pattern can also be observed from normal flooding. In 2020 and 2021, the most floods occurred in May and March respectively. Both months are in the spring season which begins in March and ends in June. Following the winter season, temperatures begin to increase in spring resulting in melted snow which, in conjunction with spring rains, will result in flooding.

## Summary of Deaths

I next look at the total deaths, summing both direct and indirect, for each flood type to determine if the most common type of floods are also the most dangerous.

```{r, out.width = "200%"}
#| label: fig-num.deaths.2020
#| fig-cap: "Number of deaths from flash floods and floods each month in 2020"
#| echo: false
#| message: false


noaa2020$deaths <- noaa2020$DEATHS_DIRECT + noaa2020$DEATHS_INDIRECT
noaa2021$deaths <- noaa2021$DEATHS_DIRECT + noaa2021$DEATHS_INDIRECT

plot1 <- noaa2020 %>% filter(EVENT_TYPE == "Flood" | EVENT_TYPE == "Flash Flood") %>%
  group_by(MONTH_NAME, EVENT_TYPE) %>% 
  summarize(num_deaths = sum(deaths)) %>% 
  mutate(MONTH_NAME = factor(MONTH_NAME, levels = month.abb)) %>% 
  arrange(MONTH_NAME) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(MONTH_NAME, num_deaths, group = EVENT_TYPE, col = EVENT_TYPE)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Number of Flood Deaths") +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") + 
  labs(title = "Number of Deaths per Month in 2020") + 
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 11),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, 2))

plot1
```

```{r, out.width="200%"}
#| label: fig-num.deaths.2021
#| fig-cap: "Number of deaths from flash floods and floods each month in 2021"
#| echo: false
#| message: false

plot2 <- noaa2021 %>% filter(EVENT_TYPE == "Flood" | EVENT_TYPE == "Flash Flood") %>%
  group_by(MONTH_NAME, EVENT_TYPE) %>% 
  summarize(num_deaths = sum(deaths)) %>% 
  mutate(MONTH_NAME = factor(MONTH_NAME, levels = month.abb)) %>% 
  arrange(MONTH_NAME) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(MONTH_NAME, num_deaths, group = EVENT_TYPE, col = EVENT_TYPE)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +

        plot.title = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14))

plot2


```

In both years, zero direct deaths and indirect deaths were reported from coastal floods and lakeshore floods. This confirms the hypothesis that the more frequently occurring floods and flash floods result in more deaths and are therefore more dangerous. Additionally, on average, flash floods are more deadly and dangerous than any other flood.

In 2020, @fig-num.floods.2020 shows that the most flash floods occurred in August. While there was a spike in the number of deaths in August, the most deaths from flash floods was in the month of March. Similarly, in 2021, @fig-num.floods.2021 depicts July having the most flash floods but the most deaths occurring in September with over 50 deaths. I continue my analysis of the most dangerous floods by looking closer at the flash floods in September of 2021 that resulted in over 50 deaths. 

## Floods Resulting from Hurricane Ida

I first looked at the disaster events that occurred in September of 2021 that lead to either direct or indirect deaths. Filtering the NOAA 2021 dataset , I discovered that there were a total of 33 such events that were flash floods mostly taking place in New York and New Jersey. Of these 33 flash floods, 31 of them contained the string "Ida" in the `EPISODE_NARRATIVE` column. This suggests that Hurricane Ida and the remnants of Hurricane Ida in September of 2021 brought about deathly flash floods to the communities on the east coast. Hurricane Ida is known as the most deadly natural disaster in the United States in 2021. 
```{r, out.width = "200%"}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

#episodes in september that resulted in deaths
sept <- noaa2021 %>% filter(MONTH_NAME=="Sep", DEATHS_DIRECT+DEATHS_INDIRECT>0)
#episodes in september that resulted in deaths that contain IDA in episode narrative
sept.ida <- noaa2021 %>% filter(MONTH_NAME=="Sep", DEATHS_DIRECT+DEATHS_INDIRECT>0, str_detect(EPISODE_NARRATIVE, "Ida"))
#16 of 18 episodes contained IDA in episode narrative, showing IDA was main cause of deaths in sept 2021
```

I now look at all disaster events in 2021 that occurred as a result of Hurricane Ida, as declared by NOAA, based on the appearance of the string "Ida" in the `EPISODE_NARRATIVE` column. I also filtered the FEMA data to contain only those episodes with the appearance of "Ida" in `declarationTitle`. I wish to compare the total property damage in each state affected by Hurricane Ida to the total amount approved for the Individual and Households Program (IHP). The IHP provides services to individuals and households affected by a disaster. Are those states with large damages to property getting the necessary aid from FEMA?

```{r}
#| label: fig-dam.aid
#| fig-cap: "Total property damage compared to total amount approved for the Invidiual and Households Program for states affected by Hurricane Ida"

#filter the episode narrative from noaa to contain the string "IDA"

#filter fema declaration title to contain ida (aid given to IDA)
femaida <- fema %>% filter(str_detect(declarationTitle, "IDA"))

#damage property done by each flood (caused by IDA) in each state affected by IDA

Taking the NOAA data on floods from Hurricane Ida, I created a dataframe that provided the total property damage for those states affected by the hurricane. The FEMA aid for Hurricane Ida was also organized into a dataframe that provided the total amount approved for the IHP for those states affected by the hurricane. @fig-dam.aid provides a comparison of total property damage to IHP aid for those states. Of those 14 states with reported property damage from Hurricane Ida, only 5 states were reported to have received IHP aid from FEMA. For Mississippi, Connecticut, and New Jersey, the total amount approved for the IHP surpassed that of the total property damage in the state. With the exception of Delaware, those states with close to $3 million or less in property damage did not receive aid for the IHP. 

It is also important to note that Louisiana was reported as having the highest amount approved for the IHP from Hurricane Ida at $1,241,154,772. However, NOAA had no reported property damage in Louisiana from Hurricane Ida. This may be a result of missing data and should be looked at further. 

# Conclusions and Future Work

An exploratory data analysis on the flood disasters in the United States in 2020 and 2021 revealed patterns in their timely occurrence and disastrous tendencies. Flash floods and normal floods are the most commonly occurring floods with more flash floods taking place during hurricane season and more normal floods taking place during the transition from winter to spring. Flash floods are the most dangerous and deadly types of floods, especially flash floods resulting from hurricanes. Looking closer at one example, Hurricane Ida in 2021, demonstrated the relationship between the total property damage and IHP aid approved for states affected by such a disastrous hurricane. Even states with hundreds of thousands of dollars in property were not reported as receiving approved aid for the IHP. 

Further analysis could be conducted with more data. The assistance data from FEMA only provides the 
aid provided by disaster number. This consolidates the assistance to a disaster that occurred in a state. Getting data that shows the aid provided to individual cities and counties would provide for an analysis on which communities are receiving more aid for the same disaster.
